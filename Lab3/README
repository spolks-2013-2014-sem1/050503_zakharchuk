Lab 3.

Create client and serial server, that allows you to transfer a file using TCP. Pay attention to exception handling, such as physical or program disconnection.

Usage:

Server: ./main <hostname> <port>
Example, ./main 127.0.0.1 3000

Client: ./main <hostname <port> <filePath>
Example, ./main 127.0.0.1 3000 /home/user/temp_file
