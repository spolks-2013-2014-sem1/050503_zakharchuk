Lab 5. Client-server program for file transfer over the network using UDP.

This lab is a modification of the previous lab. Add to client and server ability to transfer a file using UDP.
Pay attention to exception handling, such as physical or program disconnection.

Usage:

1) ./server <hostname> <port> [-u]
Example ./server 127.0.0.1 3000 -u
The program listens for incoming connections.
When the client is connected, server receives the file and saves it in the folder Received_files.
[-u] - UDP usage (by default TCP)

2) ./client <hostname> <port> <filePath> [-u]
Example, ./client 127.0.0.1 3000 /home/user/tempFile -u
The program connects to the server and then sends the file, which is situated on the path filePath.
[-u] - UDP usage (by default TCP)
