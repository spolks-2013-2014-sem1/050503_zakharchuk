Lab 8.  Parallel query processing organization on the server using processes.

This lab is a modification of lab 5.
Modify the server to the parallel
service for multiple clients by creating separate process.

Usage:

1) ./server <hostname> <port> [-u]
Example ./server 127.0.0.1 3000 -u
The program listens for incoming connections.
When the client is connected, server receives the file and saves it in the folder Received_files.
[-u] - UDP usage (by default TCP)

2) ./client <hostname> <port> <filePath> [-u]
Example, ./client 127.0.0.1 3000 /home/user/tempFile -u
The program connects to the server and then sends the file, which is situated on the path filePath.
[-u] - UDP usage (by default TCP)
